# Pixel, A Biography

This project is a mobile-first, scroll-driven website that summarizes and reinterprets The Biography of the Pixel, originally written by Alvy Ray Smith.
Through scrollytelling techniques, animations, and minimal design, the site aims to make the technical and historical journey of the pixel accessible, visual, and intuitive to a wider audience.

The storytelling experience is built to emphasize clarity, flow, and engagement, letting users feel and see the evolution of the pixel from its foundational definition to its impact on modern digital imagery.
