# Pixel, A Biography

This project is a **mobile-first** that summarizes and reinterprets *The Biography of the Pixel* by Alvy Ray Smith.  
Through **scrollytelling techniques**, animations, and minimalist design, the site makes the technical and historical journey of the pixel accessible, visual, and intuitive to a wider audience.

The storytelling experience is crafted to emphasize clarity, flow, and engagement, allowing users to feel and see the evolution of the pixel, from its foundational definition to its impact on modern digital imagery.

## 🎯 Goals

- Simplify complex concepts while preserving the original meaning  
- Visualize key moments through interactive animations and smooth transitions  
- Prioritize mobile-first navigation and readability  
- Create a formal but understandable tone, suitable for general audiences and educational use
